<blendervr-launch>
    <configuration-file file="./configurations/main-w3d.xml"/>

<!--
    If no arguments are given, this is the screen that will open when this profile_file is used. Note that with
    -screen you can choose another screen set. For example... if there's another screen set  called 'CAVE'
    you can open hhe application with the command:
    ./BLENDERVR_SOURCE/blendervr start-xml -start CURRENT_DIR/profile_spider.xml -screen CAVE       -->
<default-screen screen="console"/>
